* This contract defines a struct which both ERC20FeeProxy and BiconomyForwarder inherit. ERC20ForwardRequest specifies all the fields present in the GSN V2 ForwardRequest struct, 
* but adds the following :
* address token
* uint256 tokenGasPrice
* uint256 txGas
* uint256 batchNonce (can be removed)
* uint256 deadline 
* Fields are placed in type order, to minimise storage used when executing transactions.
